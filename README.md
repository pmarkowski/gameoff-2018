# Killowatt
The year is 20XX. After purchasing their 5 competitors, Hell Corp controls the world's oil production.
Rumour has it, they're up to no good. Hop into the brand new 20XX Hevy Killowatt, the world's first 
plug-in hybrid electric mecha (PHEM), navigate Hell Corp's dangerous facilities, and put a stop to them,
once and for all.
